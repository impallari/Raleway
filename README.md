## Description

Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family.

Initially designed by [Matt McInerney](http://blog.matt.cc/) as a [single thin weight](https://github.com/theleagueof/raleway), it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. In 2013 the Italics where added.

It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.

It also has a sister display family, Raleway Dots.
